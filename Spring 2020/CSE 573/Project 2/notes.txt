Runtime for images greater than 5
	1. It usually takes a longer time, around 20 minutes to compute panorama on images with a length greater than 5.


[OPTIONAL] Notes about source code

	1. There are 3 main sections in this code. I individually compute the panorama for images of lengths 2 and 3 in separate blocks of code.
	This is because images are easier to handle till the length of 3 and it saves processing time from the indefinite loop.

	2. For images with length greater than or equal to 4, I individually compute pixels by combining them with the best possible matches and then build the panorama one by one.
